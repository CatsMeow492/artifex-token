# Artifex Token Audit Checklist

This checklist outlines key security considerations for the Artifex (ARTX) token contract.

## Contract Design and Implementation

- [x] ERC-20 compliance: Follows the ERC-20 standard
- [x] EIP-2612 Permit: Implements gas-less approvals
- [x] Supply cap: Hard limit of 100 million tokens
- [x] Two-step ownership transfer: Prevents accidental ownership loss
- [x] UUPS upgradeability: Allows future upgrades

## Security Measures

- [ ] Static analysis: Run Slither to detect common vulnerabilities
- [x] Test coverage: Comprehensive testing in both Hardhat and Foundry
- [ ] External audit: Engage a professional audit firm
- [ ] Bug bounty: Consider post-audit bug bounty program

## Deployment Security

- [ ] Testnet deployment: Test on Arbitrum Sepolia before mainnet
- [ ] Timelock for admin functions: Consider adding a timelock for sensitive operations
- [ ] Multisig wallet: Use a multisig for the operational wallet

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Contract verification: Verify on Arbiscan
- [ ] Documentation: Complete and accurate documentation
- [ ] Monitoring: Set up monitoring for unusual activities
- [ ] Communication plan: Establish clear channels for security notifications

## Completed Items

- [x] Smart contract implementation
- [x] Unit testing
- [x] Solidity linting
- [x] TypeScript linting
- [x] Code commenting standards
